**Multi-protocol label switching** (MPLS) is a forwarding scheme designed to speed up IP packet forwarding. It was originally considered a possible replacement for the Internet Protocol but is now used as a substrate to enhance traffic engineering capabilities for ISPs (intra-AS) or data centres.

## The main idea

MPLS Is a good example of what is sometimes called a [[Shim Layer|shim layer]] which is inserted between the existing link layer (whichever one is in use) and the IP datagram layer (<u>MPLS supports any network layer protocol and link layer protocol</u>). The protocol adds fixed length (20-bit) labels in this layer, primarily to simplify hardware lookup of the next-hop.

## MPLS Header Format

- **Label**: 20-bit label value
- **Exp**: experimental use
	- Can indicate class of service
- **S**: bottom of stack indicator
	- 1 for the bottom label, 0 otherwise
- **TTL**: time to live
	- Helps remove looping packets.

## Forwarding Equivalence Class

**Forwarding Equivalence Class** (FEC) is a subset of packets that are all treated the same way by an [[Definitions/LSR|LSR]]. A packet is assigned to an FEC at the ingress of an MPLS domain.

A packet's FEC can be determined by one or more of the following:
- Source and/or address destination IP address
- Source and/or address destination port number
- Protocol ID
- Differentiated service code point
- Incoming interface

A particular [[PHB]] (scheduling and discard policy) can be defined for a given FEC.

## MPLS Operation

Hereâ€™s an overview of how MPLS operates:
- At ingress LSR of an MPLS domain, an MPLS header is inserted into a packet before forwarding. The label in the MPLS header is used to encode the packet's FEC.
- At subsequent LSRs, the label is used as an index into a [[Forwarding Table|forwarding table]] that specifies the [[Next-hop|next-hop]] and a new label.
- The old label is replaced with the new label, and the packet is forwarded to the next hop.
- Egress LSR strips the label and forwards the packet to the final destination based on the IP packet header.

## Label distribution

For each FEC, a specific path called[[LSP| Label Switching Path]] (LSP) is assigned and we need a label distribution protocol so that an LSR can inform others of the label/FEC binding it has made.

A forwarding table is constructed as the result of label distribution

## LSP route selection

- **Hop-by-hop routing**: 
	Use the route determined by the dynamic routing protocol
- **Explicit routing (ER)**: 
	The sender LSR can specify an <u>explicit route</u> (that can be selected ahead of time or dynamically) for the LSP

### Explicitly routed LSP

The advantages of ER are that we can establish LSP based on policy, QoS, etc and that we can have pre-established LSP in case of failures.

These mappings are established by signalling protocols such as **CR-LDP** and **RSVP-TE**.

## Diffserv-Aware MPLS

MPLS can be used with [[DiffServ|Differentiated Services ]]to provide [[QoS]] (*More when discussing traffic management*).

Here, LSP are configured between each ingress-egress pair, and there are two approaches:
- For each ingress-egress pair, a separate LSP can be created for each traffic class.
- For each ingress-egress pair, create a single LSP and use the Exp bits to differentiate packet classes.

In an MPLS-based network, the system can<u> efficiently handle a growing number of data flows or communications without a proportional increase in the number of LSP
</u> 

In an ISP network, the ingress router not only enforces traffic policing but also adds an MPLS header to the packet. The core routers then use the label and Exp fields to process the packet efficiently. Finally, at the egress router, the MPLS header is removed.

It is transparent to other ISPs whether an ISP's architecture is DS field-based or MPLS-based, allowing for easy interoperability between the two.

A customer domain still needs a [[Bandwidth Broker ]](BB) to allocate services and request resources on behalf of the customer domain when the [[SLA]] is dynamic.
BBs may not be necessary for MPLS-based ISP networks since the ingress router can make the admission control decision. If the requested resource is granted, the ingress router sends a PATH message to the egress router through an LSP.

## Why MPLS Protection?

IP restoration processes can be slow. When a failure occurs, OSPF, RIP, and similar protocols require updated link status information to be redistributed, resulting in [[Routing Convergence|routing table convergence]] times on the order of seconds. During convergence, looping and packet loss may occur.

MPLS enables fast failure restoration.

### MPLS protection approaches

- **End-to-End protection**
	To ensure uninterrupted data transmission between the source and destination LSRs, a backup LSP is established beforehand. The backup LSP is designed to use different links and nodes than the primary LSP, ensuring that it remains unaffected in case of a failure. However, resources must be reserved for the backup LSP to function smoothly.
	In case of a failure, it is the responsibility of the source LSR to restore the connection. Additionally, the sender must be notified of the failure so that necessary actions can be taken.
- **Local protection**
	When setting up a primary LSP, a backup LSP is also established for each potential link or node failure. Resources are allocated for each backup LSP. In case of a failure, the LSR responsible for detecting the problem switches the traffic to the backup LSP. This method of protection results in faster restoration than end-to-end protection.

## Label sticking

When using local protection, a separate set of backup LSPs must be created for every primary LSP. However, a single LSP can backup a set of primary LSPs if MPLS label stacking is used.

Each packet in a network may have multiple labels and they are arranged in a LIFO ) stack. Labels can be added to or removed from the stack at any LSR. The processing is always performed on the top of the stack.

When multiple LSPs need to follow the same path, they can be combined into a single LSP which creates a tunnel. At the beginning of the tunnel, the LSR assigns the same label to packets from different LSPs by pushing the label onto each packet's stack. At the end of the tunnel, the LSR removes the top label from the stack. This process ensures that packets from different LSPs reach their destination on the same path, without being mixed up.

### Local protection using label stacking

A bypass tunnel is an LSP used to protect a set of other LSPs that pass through a common facility. Label stacking enables multiple LSPs to use the same bypass tunnel to protect against failures.

In case of a failure, the LSR situated at the beginning of the tunnel will switch the packets received on the protected LSP x to the bypass tunnel. It will replace the old label with a new label that will be easily understood by the last node in the bypass tunnel to indicate LSP x. Additionally, it will push the bypass tunnel's label onto the label stack of the redirected packets.

On the other hand, the LSR located at the end of the tunnel will pop the bypass tunnel's label and examine the top label to determine the protected LSP that the packet is supposed to follow.
