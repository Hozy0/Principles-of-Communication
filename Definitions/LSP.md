<u>N.B. The LSP is unidirectional</u>

LSP stands for **Label Switched Path** and it refers to a predetermined route or path through an MPLS network that is established to efficiently forward data packets. 

To set up an LSP, each [[LSR|LSR]] must assign an incoming label (that has only local significance) to the LSP for the corresponding [[MPLS#Forwarding Equivalce Class|FEC]]. Then it must inform the upstream node of the assigned label and it has to learn the label that the downstream node has assigned to the LSP.
