The Bandwidth Broker (BB) is an agent responsible for allocating preferred service to users as
requested, and for configuring the network routers with the correct forwarding behaviour for the defined service. A BB is associated with a particular trust region, one per domain. A BB has a policy database that keeps the information on who can do what, when and a method of using that database to authenticate requesters. Only a BB can configure the leaf routers to deliver a particular service to flows, crucial for deploying a secure system.
