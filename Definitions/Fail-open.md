In a fail-open scenario, if a network element fails or becomes unavailable, <u>the network continues to forward traffic, even though it may not follow the preferred or optimal path.</u> Fail-open behaviour prioritises network continuity and ensures that data can still be forwarded, even if it means using suboptimal paths.

This approach may be suitable for networks that prioritise availability and robustness over performance optimisation.
