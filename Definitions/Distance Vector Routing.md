- **Distance Vector Routing**:
   - Distance vector routing, also known as distributed Bellman-Ford routing, relies on routers or nodes exchanging information about their routing tables with their neighboring routers.
   - Each router maintains a table with distance (cost) information to reach various network destinations.
   - Periodically, routers share their routing tables with neighbors, which allows them to adjust their routing decisions based on the information received.
   - Routers calculate the distance to destinations based on hop count, bandwidth, or other metrics, and select the best path accordingly.
   - RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is an example of a distance vector routing protocol.
