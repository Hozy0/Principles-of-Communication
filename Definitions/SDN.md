**Software-Defined Networking** (SDN) is an approach to networking that is based on an antithetical architecture with respect to traditional networking. 

In traditional networking, routing and traffic management decisions are made by the control plane and are tightly integrated with the data plane, which forwards data packets based on those decisions within the same network devices, such as routers and switches. However, <u>in SDN, these two planes are decoupled.</u> Control is centralised in software, usually in a controller or SDN application, and separated from the data plane, which comprises forwarding hardware devices.

SDN allows network administrators to manage centrally and program network devices through software, making networks more flexible, adaptable, and easier to configure. It enhances network agility and efficiency while reducing hardware dependencies.

SDN offers several advantages over traditional networking in various use cases; here's an example:

- **Data Centre Networks**: SDN is commonly used in data centres to enhance network flexibility and efficiency. In a data centre environment, where virtualisation and cloud computing are prevalent, SDN allows administrators to dynamically allocate network resources, prioritise traffic, and respond to changing demands. For example, suppose a company needs to scale its online services during a shopping event or handle varying workloads. In that case, SDN can adapt by reallocating resources and optimising traffic flows in real time.
