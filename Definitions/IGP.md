- An **Internal Gateway Protocol** (IGP) is used ***within*** an [[AS|AS]].
- IGP protocols are designed to facilitate routing and exchange routing information between routers within the same AS.
- Common examples of IGPs include Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS).
- IGPs are used to make routing decisions within the boundaries of an autonomous system, helping routers direct traffic within the organisation's network.

IGP convergence, or Interior Gateway Protocol convergence, refers to the process by which AS update their routing tables to reach a consistent and stable state after a change in the network's topology or routing information. ^eef67d
