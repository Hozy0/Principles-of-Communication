Routing convergence refers to the process by which a network's [[Routing Table|routing tables]] and forwarding paths adjust to reach a stable and consistent state after a change or disruption in the network. This change or disruption could be caused by factors like link failures, topology changes, or updates to routing information. The goal of routing convergence is to ensure that all routers in the network have up-to-date and consistent routing information so that data can be efficiently and accurately forwarded to its destination.
