In a fail-close scenario, if a network element fails, <u>the network takes proactive measures to prevent or minimise data forwarding over the affected portion of the network.</u>
Fail-close behaviour is typically used when network administrators want to ensure that traffic does not traverse failed or compromised elements to maintain security or avoid network congestion.

This approach prioritises network integrity and data security over continuity.
