**Network Functions Virtualisation** (NFV) allows network functions, such as firewalls, load balancers, and deep packet inspection, to be virtualised and run on standard servers or VMs rather than dedicated hardware appliances. Virtualised network functions (VNFs) can be deployed and scaled as needed in the network.
