QoS stands for "Quality of Service," and it is a set of networking techniques and technologies used to manage and improve the performance, reliability, and predictability of data transmission in computer networks. QoS allows network administrators to prioritise certain types of data traffic, allocate network resources effectively, and ensure that critical applications receive the service they need.
